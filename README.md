# Assembly-Line-Problem-Solving

An assembly scheduling is like a product processing line in a factory such as automobiles. The product will be produced using two or more assembly lines and the assembly lines run, process and work together to produce the products. And, each of the assembly lines will have n stations.

In this program, an assembly line scheduling is solved using dynamic programming to handle random generate of input for different number of stations.
